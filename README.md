# PAAL1.0

If you are here you will only really need one more thing!

The command to run this in terminal assuming it has ran successfully in the past is:

python3 /Applications/PAAL/PAAL.py


Current Version 1.0.1
- reworked autoaudit.py to better handle mac devices
- crushed some bugs if the autopilot is not given it can now handle the errors
- removed case reformatting in the autoaudit.py
